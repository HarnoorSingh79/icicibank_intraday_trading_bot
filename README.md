# icicibank_intraday_trading_bot

This project aims to exploit the nature of NSE(National Stock Exchange)(India) listed stock 'icici bank'.

during my month-long observation, I have noted the daily percentage change in the price of icici bank stock quite strongly follow the percentage that occurred in nifty bank indices.

In short, as nifty bank indices go down or up icici bank shortly follows, unlike all other bank stocks.

so this code aims to exploit this and make a profit when the opportunity arises.
